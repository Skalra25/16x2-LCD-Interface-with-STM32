# 16x2-LCD-Interface-with-STM32
Accept up to a 4 digit value from the virtual serial port on the STM Board. If the 4 digit value is one of the 10 pass-codes stored in an array, issue an auditory feedback signal and the text "access granted" to the serial port. If it is not one of the 10 allowable pass-codes, issue another appropriate auditory feedback signal and the text "access denied". Also illuminate a red led if the access is not granted and a green led if access is granted.
